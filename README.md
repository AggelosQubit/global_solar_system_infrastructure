# Global Solar System Infrastructure
```
Global solar system infrastructure refers to the idea of building a network of structures and systems in the solar system that would allow humanity to more fully explore and utilize the resources of the solar system.

This could include things like space habitats for human settlement,
mining operations on asteroids and other celestial bodies, and large-scale solar power stations.
The goal of global solar system infrastructure would be to create a sustainable and self-sufficient human presence in the solar system,

allowing us to expand our civilization beyond the confines of Earth.
This is an ambitious and long-term goal that would require significant technological advances and international cooperation,
but it has the potential to greatly benefit humanity and unlock the vast resources of the solar system.
