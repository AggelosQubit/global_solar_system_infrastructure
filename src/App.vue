	<h1>Global Solar System Infrastructure</h1>
	<p> Global solar system infrastructure refers to the idea of building a network of structures and systems in the solar system</p>
	<p> that would allow humanity to more fully explore and utilize the resources of the solar system. </p>
	<p> This could include things like space habitats for human settlement, </p>
	<p> mining operations on asteroids and other celestial bodies, and large-scale solar power stations. </p>
	<p> The goal of global solar system infrastructure would be to create a sustainable and self-sufficient human presence in the solar system, </p>
	<p> allowing us to expand our civilization beyond the confines of Earth. </p>
	<p> This is an ambitious and long-term goal that would require significant technological advances and international cooperation, </p>
	<p> but it has the potential to greatly benefit humanity and unlock the vast resources of the solar system."</p>
